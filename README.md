👋 Good day! I’m Jason but you can also call me Pembo. It's a nickname that stuck over time.

💞️ Front-end web dev is my current focus. Self-taught and committed/excited to learn from peers!  
    Currently working on building my portfolio. Check it out on my GitHub page! <link>

📫 Let's chat at pembo.dev@gmail.com - I am friendly and approachable. (Also, a huge gamer 👀)
